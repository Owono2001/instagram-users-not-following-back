# View Instagram Users Who Do Not Follow Back
Install your data from Instagram and replace the follower_1.json and following_1.json with your follower_1.json and following.json.<br>
The json files for followers and following can be found in 
connections folder -> followers_and_following 

After downloading the zip file and replacing the necessary files, you can now run the html file.

# Issues
As of now, this can only handle small sets of data and cannot work on 1000+ following and followers.

# Contribution
